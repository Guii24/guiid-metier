To do so, you can &ldquo;connect&rdquo; with the professionals who you choose, and who also wish to &ldquo;connect&rdquo; with you. Subject to your and their settings, when you connect with other Members, you will be able to search each others&rsquo; connections in order to exchange professional opportunities. We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event). It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can choose whether or not to share your own list of connections with your connections.</span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">Visitors have choices about how we use their data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">Stay Informed</span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional fashion industry topics you care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content in your feed, suggest that you follow certain members on our site, or suggest related learning content to help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your settings, we may notify others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a social action, used a feature, made new connections or were mentioned in the news.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">Career</span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities. Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a job or a specific task) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend jobs or mentees, show you and others relevant professional contacts (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are interested&nbsp;</span><strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">i</span></strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">n changing jobs and share information with recruiters. We will use your data to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters. We may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">Productivity</span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and prepare meetings with them. If your settings allow, we scan messages to provide &ldquo;bots&rdquo; or similar tools that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or recommending next steps.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span><strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">2.2 Premium Services</span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span></strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">Our premium Services help paying users to search for and contact Members through our Services, such as searching for and contacting job candidates, sales leads and co-workers, manage talent and promote content through social. We sell premium Services that provide our customers and subscribers with customized-search functionality and tools (including messaging and activity alerts) as part of our talent, marketing and sales solutions. Customers can export limited information from your profile, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and general location, such as to manage sales leads or talent, unless you opt-out. We do not provide contact information to customers as part of these premium Services without your consent. Premium Services customers can store information they have about you in our premium Services, such as a resume or contact information or sales history. The data stored about you by these customers is subject to the policies of those customers.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">2.3 Communications</span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span></strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">We contact you and enable communications between Members. We offer settings to control what messages you receive and how often you receive some types of messages. We will contact you through email, mobile phone, notices posted on our websites or apps, messages to your Guiid Metier inbox, and other ways through our Services, including text messages and push notifications. We will send you messages about the availability of our Services, security, or other service-related issues. We also send messages about how to use our Services, network updates, reminders, job suggestions and promotional messages from us and our partners. You may change your communication preferences at any time. Please be aware that you cannot opt out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices. We also enable communications between you and others through our Services, including for example invitations, groups and messages between connections.</span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span><strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">2.4 Advertising</span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span></strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">We serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services.

If you take a social action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others, including the advertiser. Subject to your settings, if you take a social action on the Guiid Metier Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads. For example, when you like a company we may include your name and photo when their sponsored content is shown.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">Ad Choices</span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">We adhere to self interest-based advertising and participate in industry opt-outs from such ads. This does not opt you out of receiving advertising; you will continue to get other ads by&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">advertisers not listed with these self regulatory tools. You can also opt-out specifically from our uses of certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">Info to Ad Providers</span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">We do not share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks except for: (i) hashed IDs or device identifiers (to the extent they are personal data in some countries); (ii) with your separate permission (e.g., in a lead generation form) or (iii) data already visible to any users of the Services (e.g., profile). However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you.

Subject to your settings, it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to our Services or users of third- party search engines). As detailed in our Help Center, your settings, degree of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services, access channels and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields in your profile.</span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">Posts, Activities, Follows, Comments, Messages</span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.</span></p>\n<ul>\n    <li style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:16pt;\">\n        <p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).</span></p>\n    </li>\n    <li style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:16pt;\">\n        <p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">In a group, posts are visible to others in the group. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change visibility in your settings.&nbsp;</span></p>\n    </li>\n    <li style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:16pt;\">\n        <p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">Any information you share through companies&rsquo; or other organizations&rsquo; pages on our Services will be viewable by it and others who visit those pages.</span></p>\n    </li>\n    <li style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:16pt;\">\n        <p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that &ldquo;page owner&rdquo; as a follower.</span></p>\n    </li>\n    <li style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:16pt;\">\n        <p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings where applicable.</span></p>\n    </li>\n    <li style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:16pt;\">\n        <p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">Subject to your settings, we let a Member know when you view their profile.</span></p>\n    </li>\n    <li style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:16pt;\">\n        <p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">When you re-share or comment on another&rsquo;s content (including ads), others will be able to view these &ldquo;social actions&rdquo; and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).</span></p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span><strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">3.2 Communication Archival</span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span></strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service. Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those Members outside of our Services.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">3.3 Others&rsquo; Services</span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span></strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">You may link your account with others&rsquo; services so that they can look up your contacts&rsquo; profiles, post your shares on such platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also appear on the services of others. Subject to your settings, other services may look up your profile. When you opt to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your Instagram or TikTok account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you the option to upload your Guiid Metier contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke the link with such accounts. Subject to your settings, excerpts from your profile will appear on the services of others (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar applications that show a user limited profile data of the person they are meeting or messaging, social media aggregators, talent and lead managers). &ldquo;Old&rdquo; profile information remains on these services until they update their data cache with changes you made to your profile.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">3.4 Related Services</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">We share your data across our different Services and Guiid Metier affiliated entities. We will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our Services. We may combine information internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span><strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">3.5 Service Providers</span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span></strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">We may use others to help us with our Services. We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">3.6 Legal Disclosures</span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span></strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">We may need to share your data when we believe it&rsquo;s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others. It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our Services (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of Guiid Metier, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">3.7 Change in Control or Sale</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">4.

If you choose to close your Guiid Metier account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have restricted your account for breach of our Policies), enforce our User Agreement, or fulfill your request to &quot;unsubscribe&quot; from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.</span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-size:16pt;\">Information you have shared with others (e.g., through InMail, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you close your account or delete the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members have copied out of our Services. Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source.
